Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding and interpreting data before delving into complex modeling or analysis. In this tutorial, we will perform an EDA using Python to examine the relationship between monthly charge and churn in a telecom dataset. Specifically, we will employ a T-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the monthly charges between customers who churn and those who do not.  
### Dataset Description
Our dataset contains information about telecom customers, including their monthly charge and churn status (whether they have churned or not). We aim to explore whether the monthly charge has a discernible impact on churn.

### Steps in the Exploratory Data Analysis

1. **Loading the Dataset**: We will begin by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: In this step, we will handle any missing values, perform data transformations, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

3. **Univariate Analysis**: We will visualize the distribution of the monthly charge using a histogram or kernel density plot. This will provide insights into the range, central tendency, and spread of the charges.

4. **Bivariate Analysis**: To investigate the relationship between monthly charge and churn, we will create a box plot or violin plot, comparing the charges for customers who churned and those who did not. This will help us determine if there are significant differences in the charges between the two groups.

5. **T-test for Statistical Significance**: To quantify the significance of the observed differences, we will perform a T-test between the monthly charges of churned and non-churned customers. This test will assess whether the differences we observed are statistically significant.

 
By following these steps, we will gain insights into the relationship between monthly charge and churn in the telecom dataset. The T-test will allow us to determine if the observed differences in monthly charges between churned and non-churned customers are statistically significant.

This Python code analysis delves into the usage of predictive analytics, specifically applying multiple logistic regression for customer behavior prediction in terms of bandwidth usage. The primary objective is to employ proactive strategies to predict churn usage, thereby optimizing the customer experience.

The analysis seeks to test a hypothesis: Can we use logistic regression as an efficient tool to predict churn usage given a specific dataset?
